# Mental_Health_ConsoleApplication
This Self-help program is designed to determine the mental illness from a list of mental  illnesses a patient can have and then tend to their illness in an attempt to improve their  mental health in a significant way while keeping track of their stress levels in case they  may be a danger to themselves.

This was the second-semester project of our BSc Computer Science from the Object Oriented Programming Language Course, developed as a console application on C++.

This program provides the user with detailed knowledge and guidance and creates 
awareness among them on what mental illness they might have and what measures they
